      <p class="site-intro__desc"> I am a software engineer, machine learning practitioner and writer. </p>
      <p class="site-intro__desc"> I am currently a software developer at OpenText. Previously, I was a Frontend Engineer at Rubikloud (acquired by Kinaxis) and a Ruby on Rails Developer at FlipGive. I like to work on a variety of challenging problems in different domains and am always interested in learning, honing my craft and reinventing myself.</p>

      <p class="site-intro__desc"> In terms of formal education, I have a Master's degree in Data Science and Analytics from Ryerson University and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from McGill University. </p>

      <p class="site-intro__desc"> Whether it's tech, non-fiction, fiction or English literature, I am an avid reader. I believe there is enormous untapped potential in reading and writing, in being able to peek into another person's brain and creativity through words, in assimilating and disseminating knowledge effectively.</p>
