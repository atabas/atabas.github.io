Highlighting your achievements does not mean bragging - there's a fine line between the two. Here's why I think promoting your work is important:

- Visibility: If you don't highlight your work, no one else will. Simply putting your head down and working harder doesn't guarantee/solidify your seat at the table.
- Networking: Promoting your work may open doors to other opportunities (internally at work or externally).
- Inspiration: When people around you do well, it motivates you to be better, and vice versa. It's an opportunity to pull each other up and to be happy for someone else.
